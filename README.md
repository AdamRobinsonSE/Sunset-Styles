## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

A website built using NASA's APIs. You can select any date to see the media of the day, whether it be a video or image. Along with the description of what you're seeing.

## Optimizations

In the future I want to add many more options including images captured by the Mars Rover. I also want to go back and clean-up my client-side JavaScript after learning much more.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson learned here was not all APIs are created equal. A lot of their endpoints go to no where or are no longer supported. It takes time to go through all the data and find what is relevent to the project.
