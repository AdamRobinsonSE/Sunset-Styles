## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

## Optimizations

In the future I want to take advantage of sprites for faster loading.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson learned here was not all APIs are created equal. A lot of their endpoints go to no where or are no longer supported. It takes time to go through all the data and find what is relevent to the project.
