## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

In the future I want to take advantage of sprites for faster loading.

## Lessons Learned:

A reminder to manage frustrations. A silly mistake of not using the right filepath in CSS lead to a several hour headache of why I couldn't get an image to load.
